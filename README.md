# pahkit
An AutoHotKey gui tool that allows flexible command management to supply more ergonomic options for Windows.
The most common use case is to simply map your common browser bookmarks and applications so that they can easily be launched without navigating using the mouse.
This was originally developed to assist with ergonomics and efficiency.

Intended pronunciation: pocket
